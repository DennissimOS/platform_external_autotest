This is a test that emulates following user behavior:
Manually add an Epson printer (user-provided ppd file) and print a pdf.

In the process of adding a printer, API is triggered to download a
component (escpr).

When printing the pdf, the printing request sent to printer is caught by
a fake printer which compares the request to a golden file to verify its
correctness.
