This is the portion of the Build Verification Test suite required to
pass the ChromeOS ARC Commit Queue.  Test failures prevent code from
being included in the ARC Android tree:
  * ChromeOS ARC CLs must pass these tests prior to being accepted into
    the tree.
  * A new ChromeOS ARC build must pass these tests prior to the build
    being included in a ChromeOS canary build.

Requirements for a test to be in this suite:
 1. A test failure should indicate that the product is not fit for
    release on any channel.
 2. A test failure must reliably indicate a bug in the product, and
    not a bug in the test.

@param build: The name of the image to test.
              Ex:cyan-release/R60-9517.0.0;git_nyc-arc/cheets_x86-user/3512523
@param board: The board to test on. Ex: cyan
@param pool: The pool of machines to utilize for scheduling. If pool=None
             board is used.
@param check_hosts: require appropriate live hosts to exist in the lab.
@param SKIP_IMAGE: (optional) If present and True, don't re-image devices.
