Verify cr50 board id behavior on a board id locked image.

Check that cr50 will not accept mismatched board ids when it is running a board
id locked image.

Set the board id on a non board id locked image and verify cr50 will rollback
when it is updated to a mismatched board id image.

All of the path args are optional. If they are given, then the test will use
the local images to run the test. If they aren't, the test will download the
needed cr50 images.
